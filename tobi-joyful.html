                Divine Jesus, we offer this Rosary contemplating the mysteries of our redemption. Grant us through the intercession of the Virgin Mary, your most Holy Mother, the virtues we need to pray well and the graces to win the indulgences of this Holy devotion. We offer particularly:<br>
                <p class="instruction">
                    Say your intentions here.

        <div class="paragraph">
            <p>
                I unite with all the saints in heaven, with all the just on earth, and with all the faithful here present. I unite with you, my Jesus, in order to praise your holy Mother worthily and to praise you in her and through her. I renounce all distractions which may arise during this Rosary. I desire to say it with attention and devotion as if it were the last of my life.<br><br>
                We offer you, Lord Jesus, this Creed in honor of all the mysteries of our faith, the Our Father and three Hail Marys in honor of the unity of your being and the Trinity of your persons. We ask of you a lively faith, a firm hope and an ardent charity. Amen.

                Apostles&#39; Creed

        </div>
        <div class="paragraph">
            <p>
                I believe in God, the Father almighty, Creator of heaven and earth, and in Jesus Christ, his only Son, our Lord, who was conceived by the Holy Spirit, born of the Virgin Mary, suffered under Pontius Pilate, was crucified, died and was buried; he descended into hell; on the third day he rose again from the dead; he ascended into heaven, and is seated at the right hand of God the Father almighty; from there he will come to judge the living and the dead. I believe in the Holy Spirit, the holy Catholic Church, the communion of saints, the forgiveness of sins, the resurrection of the body, and life everlasting. Amen.
