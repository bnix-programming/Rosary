                            only Son, our Lord, who was conceived by the Holy Spirit, born of the Virgin Mary, suffered
                            under Pontius Pilate, was crucified, died and was buried; he descended into hell; on the
                            third
                            day he rose again from the dead; he ascended into heaven, and is seated at the right hand of

Mary was invited to conceive him in whom the "whole fullness of deity" would dwell "bodily" &#40;Col. 2:9&#41;.

John was "filled with the Holy Spirit even from his mother's womb" (Lk. 1:15, 41) by Christ himself, whom the Virgin Mary had just conceived by the Holy Spirit. Mary's visitation to Elizabeth thus became a visit from God to his people (Lk. 1:68).

                            CCC p. 527 - Jesus' circumcision, on the eighth day after his birth (Lk. 2:21), is the sign of his incorporation into Abraham's descendants, into the people of the covenant. It is the sign of his submission to the Law (Gal. 4:4) and his deputation to Israel's worship, in which he will participate throughout his life. This sign prefigures that "circumcision of Christ" which is Baptism (Col. 2:11-13).

                            CCC p. 534 - The finding of Jesus in the temple is the only event that breaks the silence of the Gospels about the hidden years of Jesus (Lk. 2:41-52). Here Jesus lets us catch a glimpse of the mystery of his total consecration to a mission that flows from his divine sonship: "Did you not know that I must be about my Father's work?" (Lk. 2:49) Mary and Joseph did not understand these words, but they accepted them in faith. Mary "kept all these things in her heart" during the years Jesus remained hidden in the silence of an ordinary life.
