                        <p>
                            CCC p. 612 - The cup of the New Covenant, which Jesus anticipated when he offered himself at the Last Supper, is afterwards accepted by him from his Father's hands in his agony in the garden at Gethsemani (Cf. Mt. 26:42; Lk. 22:20), making himself "obedient unto death". Jesus prays: "My Father, if it be possible, let this cup pass from me" (Phil. 2:8; Mt. 26:39; Cf. Heb. 5:7-8). Thus he expresses the horror that death represented for his human nature. Like ours, his human nature is destined for eternal life; but unlike ours, it is perfectly exempt from sin, the cause of death (Cf. Rom. 5:12; Heb. 4:15). Above all, his human nature has been assumed by the divine person of the "Author of life", the "Living One" (Cf. Acts. 3:15; Rev. 1:17; Jn. 1:4; 5:26). By accepting in his human will that the Father's will be done, he accepts his death as redemptive, for "he himself bore our sins in his body on the tree" (1 Pet. 224; Cf. Mt. 26:42).

                            CCC p. 572 - The Church remains faithful to the interpretation of "all the Scriptures" that Jesus gave both before and after his Passover: "Was it not necessary that the Christ should suffer these things and enter into his glory?" (Lk. 24:26-27, 44-45) Jesus' sufferings took their historical, concrete form from the fact that he was "rejected by the elders and the chief priests and the scribes", who handed "him to the Gentiles to be mocked and scourged and crucified" (Mk. 8:31; Mt. 20:19).

By his obedience unto death, Jesus accomplished the substitution of the suffering Servant, who "makes himself an offering for sin", when "he bore the sin of many", and who "shall make many to be accounted righteous", for "he shall bear their iniquities" (Isa. 53:10-12). Jesus atoned for our faults and made satisfaction for our sins to the Father (Cf. Council of Trent 1547: DS 1529).

                            CCC p. 618 - The cross is the unique sacrifice of Christ, the "one mediator between God and men" (1 Tim 2:5). But because in his incarnate divine person he has in some way united himself to every man, "the possibility of being made partners, in a way known to God, in the paschal mystery" is offered to all men (GS. 22 § 5; cf. § 2). He calls his disciples to "take up [their] cross and follow [him]" (Mt. 16:24), for "Christ also suffered for [us], leaving [us] an example so that [we] should follow in his steps." (1 Pet. 2:21). In fact Jesus desires to associate with his redeeming sacrifice those who were to be its first beneficiaries (Cf. Mk 10:39; Jn. 21:18-19; Col. 1:24). This is achieved supremely in the case of his mother, who was associated more intimately than any other person in the mystery of his redemptive suffering (Cf. Lk. 2:35). Apart from the cross there is no other ladder by which we may get to heaven (St. Rose of Lima, cf. P. Hansen, Vita mirabilis Louvain, 1668).

                            CCC p. 616 - It is love "to the end" (Jn. 13:1) that confers on Christ's sacrifice its value as redemption and reparation, as atonement and satisfaction. He knew and loved us all when he offered his life (Cf. Gal. 2:20; Eph. 5:2, 25). Now "the love of Christ controls us, because we are convinced that one has died for all; therefore all have died" (2 Cor. 5:14). No man, not even the holiest, was ever able to take on himself the sins of all men and offer himself as a sacrifice for all. The existence in Christ of the divine person of the Son, who at once surpasses and embraces all human persons, and constitutes himself as the Head of all mankind, makes possible his redemptive sacrifice for all.

Hail, Sovereign princess, to whom all owe subjection in Heaven and on earth! Hail, sure Refuge of sinners, Our Lady of Mercy, who hast never refused any request.
